Creation of both UDP and TCP sockets to create an online chat-application using the USF stargate servers. Using the created UDP socket, a user is able to display their online presence to the stargate server, showing anyone else who is also connected to this server their online presence. If a user logs off, we are also able to display that they have went offline

Using the created TCP socket, a user is able to send a message directly on the server and even mention (@) a user to create a one on one conversation between them.

The current application can hold a maximum of 60 users messaging at once on the server.
